<span id="title-text"> Developer : Legacy Search Engine Bundle </span> {#title-heading .pagetitle}
======================================================================

**Legacy Search Engine** is the default search engine, it is SQL based
and uses Doctrine’s database connection. So its connections are, and
should be, defined in the same way as for storage engine, and no further
specific configuration is needed.

Its features and performance are limited, and if you have specific
search or performance needs you should rather look towards using
[Solr](Solr-Bundle_31430592.html).

<span style="color: rgb(0,98,147);">S</span>earch can be configured
independently from storage, and the following configuration example
shows both the default values, and how you configure legacy as the
search engine:

**ezpublish.yml**

~~~~ brush:
ezpublish:
    repositories:
        main:
            storage:
                engine: legacy
                connection: default
            search:
                engine: legacy
                connection: default
~~~~
