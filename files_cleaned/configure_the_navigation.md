PlatformUI Navigation Hub {#Configurethenavigation-PlatformUINavigationHub}
-------------------------

As written in the [PlatformUI technical
introduction](Extending-eZ-Platform_31429689.html), the Navigation Hub
gives access to 4 navigation zones which have a set of navigation items.
Each Navigation Item is actually a View in the Navigation Hub which can
generate one or more links in the menu. Most Navigation Items can even
be seen as a View of a given application route. A Navigation Item View
is also responsible for handling its *selected state*. This means that
the Navigation Items are notified when the application matches a new
route and the view can then decide to react accordingly.

PlatformUI comes with 3 different implementations of Navigation Item.
They all generate a link to a route with a given anchor text and they
differ by the ability to check if the newly matched route in the
application is the route they represent:

-   the base implementation is `Y.eZ.NavigationItemView`. When the
    matched application route changes, it sets its selected state if the
    navigation item route name matches the name of the new matched route
    in the application
-   the `Y.eZ.NavigationItemParameterView` implementation adds a check
    on a route parameter. So to appear selected, the route names must
    match and a given route parameter should be the same in both the
    application matched route and in the route the view is representing
-   the `Y.eZ.NavigationItemSubtreeView` also adds a match on a route
    parameter, but in this case it considers the `id` route parameter
    and checks whether the matched id in the application route is a
    descendant of a given Location id.

The default structure of the Navigation Hub is defined in the
[Navigation Hub view service
attributes](https://github.com/ezsystems/PlatformUIBundle/blob/master/Resources/public/js/views/services/ez-navigationhubviewservice.js#L377){.external-link}.

Adding a new navigation item {#Configurethenavigation-Addinganewnavigationitem}
----------------------------

### Plugin for the Navigation Hub view service {#Configurethenavigation-PluginfortheNavigationHubviewservice}

Since the menu structure is defined in the Navigation Hub view service,
we need to write a plugin for the Navigation Hub view service. Again,
weâ€™ll create a module that will define a plugin. So the first thing to
do is to declare our new module in `yui.yml`:

**yui.yml**

~~~~ brush:
ezconf-navigationplugin:
    requires: ['ez-pluginregistry', 'ez-viewservicebaseplugin'] # ez-viewservicebaseplugin instead of plugin, base for plugins for view services
    dependencyOf: ['ez-navigationhubviewservice']
    path: %extending_platformui.public_dir%/js/views/services/plugins/ezconf-navigationplugin.js
~~~~

View service plugins are a bit special, they need to follow a specific
interface provided by `Y.eZ.Plugin.ViewServiceBase` which is defined in
the `ez-viewservicebaseplugin` module, so our module needs to require
it.

Then, the base plugin can be written on disk. It is very close to the
base plugin written in the [Alter the JavaScript Application routing
step](Alter-the-JavaScript-Application-routing_31430241.html):

**ezconf-navigationplugin.js**

~~~~ brush:
YUI.add('ezconf-navigationplugin', function (Y) {
    Y.namespace('eZConf.Plugin');

    // view service plugins must extend Y.eZ.Plugin.ViewServiceBase
    // Y.eZ.Plugin.ViewServiceBase provides several method allowing to deeply
    // hook into the view service behaviour
    Y.eZConf.Plugin.NavigationPlugin = Y.Base.create('ezconfNavigationPlugin', Y.eZ.Plugin.ViewServiceBase, [], {
        initializer: function () {
            var service = this.get('host'); // the plugged object is called host

            console.log("Hey, I'm a plugin for NavigationHubViewService");
            console.log("And I'm plugged in ", service);
        },
    }, {
        NS: 'ezconfNavigation'
    });

    Y.eZ.PluginRegistry.registerPlugin(
        Y.eZConf.Plugin.NavigationPlugin, ['navigationHubViewService']
    );
});
~~~~

At this point, if you refresh you browser, the navigation hub should
remain the same but you should see new messages in the console.

### Adding a new navigation item {#Configurethenavigation-Addinganewnavigationitem.1}

Now that we have plugin plugged in the Navigation Hub View service, we
can change the menu structure. Among others methods, the Navigation Hub
view service has an [`addNavigationItem`
method](http://ezsystems.github.io/platformui-javascript-api/classes/eZ.NavigationHubViewService.html#method_addNavigationItem){.external-link}
to add a navigation item in a given zone, so we can use it in our plugin
to add a new item:

**ezconf-navigationplugin.js**

~~~~ brush:
YUI.add('ezconf-navigationplugin', function (Y) {
    Y.namespace('eZConf.Plugin');

    Y.eZConf.Plugin.NavigationPlugin = Y.Base.create('ezconfNavigationPlugin', Y.eZ.Plugin.ViewServiceBase, [], {
        initializer: function () {
            var service = this.get('host');

            console.log("Hey, I'm a plugin for NavigationHubViewService");
            console.log("And I'm plugged in ", service);

            console.log("Let's add the navigation item in the Content zone");
            service.addNavigationItem({
                Constructor: Y.eZ.NavigationItemView,
                config: {
                    title: "List contents",
                    identifier: "ezconf-list-contents",
                    route: {
                        name: "eZConfList" // same route name of the one added in the app plugin
                    }
                }
            }, 'platform'); // identifier of the zone called "Content" in the UI
        },
    }, {
        NS: 'ezconfNavigation'
    });

    Y.eZ.PluginRegistry.registerPlugin(
        Y.eZConf.Plugin.NavigationPlugin, ['navigationHubViewService']
    );
});
~~~~

At this point, if you refresh you browser, you should see a new entry in
the *Content* zone called *List contents*. Clicking on this link should
even get you to the page defined [in the previous
step](Define-a-View_31430243.html). And you can also notice that the
navigation item gets a special style (a green bottom border) when the
`eZConfList` route is matched and that it loses this style if you
navigate elsewhere.

Results and next step:

<span
class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-approve confluence-information-macro-icon"></span>
The resulting code can be seen in [the 5\_navigation tag on
GitHub](https://github.com/ezsystems/ExtendingPlatformUIConferenceBundle/releases/tag/5_navigation){.external-link},
this step result can also be viewed as [a diff between tags `4_view` and
`5_navigation`](https://github.com/ezsystems/ExtendingPlatformUIConferenceBundle/compare/4_view...5_navigation){.external-link}.

The next step is then [to build and display the content
list](Build-the-content-list_31430249.html).
