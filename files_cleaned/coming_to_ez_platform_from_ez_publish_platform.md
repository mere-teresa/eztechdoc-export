<span id="title-text"> Developer : Coming to eZ Platform from eZ Publish Platform </span> {#title-heading .pagetitle}

eZ Publish Platform (5.x) was a transitional version of the eZ CMS,
bridging the gap between the earlier generation called eZ Publish
(sometimes referred to as *legacy*), and the current eZ Platform
Enterprise Edition for Developers.

eZ Publish Platform introduced a new Symfony-based technology stack that
could be run along the old (*legacy*) one. This fluid change allows eZ
Publish users to migrate to eZ Platform Enterprise Edition for
Developers in two steps, using the 5.x version as an intermediary
stepping stone.

The migration process from eZ Publish Platform to eZ Platform Enterprise
Edition for Developers is described in [Upgrading from 5.4.x and 2014.11
to 16.xx](Upgrading-from-5.4.x-and-2014.11-to-16.xx_31430322.html).
