Let’s Connect! {#CommunityResources-Let'sConnect!}
--------------

In the course of its development eZ Platform has been deeply rooted in
its community. This remains true, with many invaluable contributions by
dedicated community members who play a key role in the continuous
development of eZ Platform. 

eZ partners, customers, independent developers, designers, and digital
content enthusiasts can contribute to important web projects, influence
the [eZ
roadmap](https://doc.ez.no/display/MAIN/eZ+Platform+and+eZ+Studio+Release+Process+and+Roadmap),
and ensure the platform stays on top of market trends and organizations’
needs.

This section provides information about the benefits you can draw from
the community and about how you can contribute to eZ Platform’s
development yourself.
