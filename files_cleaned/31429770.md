<span id="title-text"> Developer : Implement the Tweet\\Value class </span> {#title-heading .pagetitle}
===========================================================================

The Value class of a Field Type is by design very simple. It is meant to
be stateless, and as lightweight as possible. Therefore, this class must
contain as little logic as possible, as this is the responsibility of
the Type class .

The Value will at least contain:

-   public properties, used to store the actual data 

-   an implementation of the `__toString()` method (required by the
    Value interface we inherit from)

By default, the constructor from `      FieldType\Value    ` will be
used, and allows you to pass a hash of property/value pairs. In our
example, we can see that we can override it as well if we want.

The Tweet Field Type is going to store three things:

-   The tweet’s URL

-   The tweet’s author URL

-   The body, as an HTML string  

At this point, we don’t care where those are stored. All we care about
is what we want our Field Type to expose as an API. We end up with the
following properties:

**eZ/FieldType/Tweet/Value.php**

~~~~ brush:
/**
* Tweet URL on twitter.com (http://twitter.com/UserName/status/id).
* @var string
*/
public $url;

 
/**
* Author's tweet URL (http://twitter.com/UserName)
* @var string
*/
public $authorUrl;

 
/**
* The tweet's embed HTML
* @var string
*/
public $contents;
~~~~

The only thing left to honor the `      FieldType\Value    ` interface
is the `      __toString()` method. Let’s say that ours will return the
tweet’s URL:

**eZ/FieldType/Tweet/Value.php**

~~~~ brush:
public function __toString()
{
   return $this->url;
}
~~~~
