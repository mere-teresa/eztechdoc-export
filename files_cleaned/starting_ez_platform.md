Once you have your eZ Platform installed, all you need to do to start it
is to run your Apache server. Then you can access your eZ Platform’s
front and back office. To access the UI backend, add `/ez` to your
installation URL.

When it comes to the server, you can use the following options:

-   [Web Server](Web-Server_31429554.html)
-   [PHP’s built-in server](31429556.html)
