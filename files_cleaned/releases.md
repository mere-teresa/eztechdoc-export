**Release FAQ**

*Question*: Prior to the Long Term Support (LTS) release of eZ Platform
v1.7.0, I see several different product names. How can I learn more
about changes to product naming and features over the years?

*Answer:* eZ Platform and eZ Platform Enterprise Edition are the names
of the latest versions. eZ Systems has a rich history of innovation and
growth, represented by several iterations over almost two decades. As a
result, it may be helpful to read more about that history if you are
interested in the versions released prior to eZ Platform and eZ Platform
Enterprise Edition version 1.7.0 (LTS) released on December 15, 2016, to
help you navigate the product names and features from the past. Open
Source Community Member and eZ Partner Gaetano Giunta (CTO of Kaliop UK)
has contributed a recent blog post which you may find
