The Story Behind the Tutorial - Bike Rides {#BuildingaBicycleRouteTrackerineZPlatform-TheStoryBehindtheTutorial-BikeRides}
==========================================

We’ll work according to the following story:

**The Story**

*A good friend has a spreadsheet which details all her bike rides, and
she knows you are a professional webmaster. She asks for your help in
building a website detailing the rides. She wants to upload photos from
each ride.*  
*She has no experience with web development. Some of her friends are
interested in browsing and searching her “ride log”. In the near future,
she wants to be able to add rides by herself, and even open this
possibility to her friends.*

**Specifications**

The “customer” requirements are:

-   A list of all rides in table form
-   Viewing photos of a ride

**More to come…**
