While we are doing our best to make sure our documentation fulfills all
your needs, there is always place for improvement. If you’d like to
contribute to our docs, you can do the following:

-   **Add comments.** Whenever you notice a mistake or possible
    improvement in any of the topics, leave a comment or suggestion at
    the bottom of the page.
-   **Create a JIRA issue.** You can also report any omissions or
    inaccuracies you find by creating a JIRA issue. See [Report and
    follow issues: The bugtracker](31429592.html) on how to do this.
    Remember to add the “Documentation” component to your issue to make
    sure we don’t lose track of it.
-   **Visit Slack.** The \#documentation-contrib channel on [eZ
    Community Slack
    team](http://ez-community-on-slack.herokuapp.com){.external-link} is
    the place to drop your comments, suggestions, or proposals for
    things you’d like to see covered in documentation. (You can use the
    link to get an auto-invite to Slack).
-   **Contact the Doc Team.** If you’d like to add to any part of the
    documentation, you can also contact the Doc Team directly at
    <doc-team@ez.no.>
