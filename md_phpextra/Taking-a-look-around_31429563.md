Once you have the Demo installed, take a look around it to familiarize
yourself with the interface of eZ Platform.

To access the back office of your installation, append `/ez` to its
path: &lt;`your_installation path>/ez`. You will be prompted for the
username and password, which by default are:

username: admin  
password: publish

Back office interface overview {#Takingalookaround-Backofficeinterfaceoverview}
------------------------------

The navigation hub at the top lets you switch between eZ Platform
interface (Content) and interfaces for eZ Enterprise solutions (Page and
Performance), as well as the Admin Panel.

The Content mode is the part of the interface which is the main
workspace of editors and users. It is responsible for creating, editing
and managing content.

Page and Performance modes are available if your have an eZ Enterprise
subscription. Take a look at [Get Started with eZ
Enterprise](Get-Started-with-eZ-Enterprise_31429569.html) to learn more.

The Admin Panel lets you manage the details of your installation,
including building the content model and managing permissions.

 

Project structure {#Takingalookaround-Projectstructure}
-----------------

You can also take a look at the way the project files are structured on
the example of the Demo Bundle. See [Structuring an eZ Platform
Project](Best-Practices_31429687.html) for more information.
