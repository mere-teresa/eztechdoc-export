Now your installation is ready and you’re on your way to starting work
with eZ Platform.

To access the back office of your installation, append `/ez` to its
path: &lt;`your_installation path>/ez`. You will be prompted for the
username and password, which by default are:

username: admin  
password: publish

 

A clean installation of eZ Platform is empty, so you only get a single
page with a rudimentary content model. This is a blank canvas for you to
create and customize your own structure.

If you’d like to take a look at an example of using the system to
construct a fully functional page, you can also [install eZ Platform
with the Demo Bundle](eZ-Platform-Demo_31429540.html).
