Besides a “clean” eZ Platform installation there is an option to install
eZ Platform with demo content. Demo installation is prepared for the
presentation of how eZ Platform works and handles the content using real
life examples.

Installation of eZ Platform Demo is very similar to a standard “clean”
installation. Demo provides some previously prepared content and is
stored in a separate github repository - you can find
it [here.](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezplatform-demo){.external-link}

Installation requires Composer global installation. You can find more
information about using Composer [here.](Using-Composer_31431588.html)

To perform eZ Platform demo installation use commands below in the
terminal/bash/command-line interface. 

~~~~ brush:
composer create-project --no-dev --keep-vcs ezsystems/ezplatform-demo
cd ezplatform-demo
  
php app/console ezplatform:install demo
~~~~

  
Now you can check out the project structure and capabilities of the
system.

It is not recommended to start your own project on demo installation.
