# Step 1 - Getting Ready

eZ Platform is a new CMS written in PHP5 using Symfony2 Full Stack.

You will need a web server, a relational database and PHP5.x+ in order to follow this tutorial. An \*AMP web server is sufficient. You can use a local server on your own computer.

Once you have installed eZ Platform, configured your server, and created your database (see aside) started your web server, you need to create a database for this tutorial.

 

Tip: you can use the local PHP built-in web server for this Tutorial !

**Database Creation**

 In this tutorial, we'll use the database name "`ezplatformtutorial`".

You can create this using a GUI tool, or on the command line. For MySQL you can use this query: `` `CREATE DATABASE ezplatformtutorial CHARACTER SET UTF8` ``. You can perform the equivalent action on the database of your choice. We've seen good results with MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and others.

## **Now you are ready to begin the Tutorial!**

As we did a clean install, the root content will be displayed using the default content view template.

*Our website is quite raw for the moment.*

We will customize this default content view template in the next steps. After that, we'll create your Content Model and populate your content tree.
