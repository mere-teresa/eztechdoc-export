# Content Model: Content is King!

Everyone knows that Content is King, and in eZ Platform, everything is Content!

Take a look at the content model underlying eZ Platform.

 

### Content model overview

The content structure in eZ is based on ideas borrowed from Object-Oriented programming, as seen in popular languages such as C\#, Java or PHP.

In this understanding an "object" in the eZ Platform is called a Content Item and represents a single piece of content: an article, a blog post, an image, a product, etc. Each Content item is an instance of a "class," called a Content Type.

 

 

An introduction to the eZ content model aimed at non-developer users, is available at [Under the hood, concepts and organization](https://doc.ez.no/display/USER/2.+Under+the+hood%2C+concepts+and+organization).
