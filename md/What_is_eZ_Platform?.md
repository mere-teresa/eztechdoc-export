# What is eZ Platform?

eZ Platform is an open-source, Symfony-based CMS. With its modern architecture and flexibility it lets you customize, extend and scale your sites and apps with ease. It is built on top of the Symfony full-stack framework and enables you to tailor your content model and distribute your content however you like.

 

**Take control of your content:**

Seamlessly deliver content on your site or app and use our fully featured REST API to integrate content from apps or deliver Content as a Service.

**Take advantage of Symfony, the leading PHP framework:**

Develop in a very similar way to pure Symfony, with the same templating system, Twig, the same library for deployment and version dependency, Composer, and many other Symfony bundles and components.

**Speed up time-to-market:**

Developers who use Symfony can start customizing and extending eZ Platform right out of the gate. New to Symfony? You have plenty to gain.

**Start with clean code:**

eZ carries a substantially low level of technical debt compared to many other CMSs.
