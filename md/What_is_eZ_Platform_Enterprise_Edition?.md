# What is eZ Platform Enterprise Edition?

eZ Platform Enterprise Edition is a commercial addition and extension to eZ Platform. It makes use of everything that the platform has to offer, and expands it capabilities.

Enterprise contains a new intuitive, easy-to-learn editing interface called Studio UI, but also adds new functionalities to the existing interfaces. The main features available in eZ Enterprise are:

 

**Inline editing of content:**

eZ Enterprise's Studio UI lets you create block-based Landing Pages using drag-and-drop. This makes building them easy for editors even with no web design experience or HTML knowledge, using prebuilt elements such as headers, banners, image galleries, content lists, tags and more. At the same time, developers can customize Landing Pages by creating adaptable layouts and offering their own custom blocks to be placed in them.

Working with a Landing Page (in the User doc) describes how to use the Inline editor.

**Creating Landing Pages with customizable blocks:**

You can quickly switch between working on and previewing Landing Pages, which makes for comfortable editing and better control of your content.

[Creating Landing Page blocks (Enterprise)](Creating_Landing_Page_blocks__Enterprise_) shows how to create and customize you own blocks.

**Scheduling automatic publication of content on Landing Pages:**

Using a special Schedule Block you can set up content on your Landing Pages to be published according to a custom schedule, at predefined dates and times. A Timeline slider lets you preview what the pages will look like at any time.

 [Scheduling](https://doc.ez.no/display/USER/5.+Publishing#id-5.Publishing-Scheduling(Enterprise)) (User doc) presents how to use this block to plan airtimes.

**Content review workflow:**

Flex Workflow is a collaboration feature. You can send your content draft to any user and let them look through, modify it and send it onward through your review process.
