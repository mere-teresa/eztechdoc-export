<span class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-info confluence-information-macro-icon"></span>
Path to where you can find specification of the version you have:

`vendor/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/doc/specifications/rest/REST-API-V2.rst`

Online version for latest version:

`https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/doc/specifications/rest/REST-API-V2.rst`

About the REST specification structure
--------------------------------------

Resources are grouped by chapters: <a href="https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/doc/specifications/rest/REST-API-V2.rst#content" class="external-link">Content</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/doc/specifications/rest/REST-API-V2.rst#content-types" class="external-link">Content Types</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/doc/specifications/rest/REST-API-V2.rst#user-management" class="external-link">User</a>. In each of those chapters, you will first get an overview, with a table crossing every resource with every applicable HTTP verb, and giving you a summary of the action.

Then throughout the chapter, grouped into sub-chapters, is the detailed documentation for every resource, with:

-   The resource string
-   The HTTP verb with override, if applicable
-   A description of what this resource does
-   Which headers are supported, and how to use them
-   Which error codes can occur
-   Most of the time, a request + response example
