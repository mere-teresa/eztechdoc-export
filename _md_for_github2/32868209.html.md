<span id="title-text"> Developer : eZ Enterprise Beginner Tutorial - It's a Dog's World </span>
===============================================================================================

Created by <span class="author"> Dominika Kurek</span>, last modified on Dec 19, 2016

This tutorial will guide you through the process of making and customizing a front page for your website. For this purpose we will use a feature of eZ Platform Enterprise Edition called **Landing Page**. 

Landing Page is a special type of page that lets <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="7c3e91d5-8490-4e10-9868-0d6533f19dcd">the Editor</span> easily create and customize a complex, multi-zone entrance point to your website. In this tutorial you will learn both how to make use of out-of-the-box elements of the feature and how to extend it to fit your specific needs.

Intended audience
-----------------

This tutorial is intended for a beginner with basic knowledge of the workings of eZ Platform. Ideally, you should be familiar with the concepts covered in the [Building a Bicycle Route Tracker in eZ Platform tutorial](Building-a-Bicycle-Route-Tracker-in-eZ-Platform_31431606.html).

Learning outcomes
-----------------

After going through this tutorial, you will:

-   Have a working knowledge of Landing Page functionality and architecture
-   Be able to create a Landing Page and customize its layout
-   Be able to prepare and customize Schedule Blocks
-   Be able to create a custom block to be placed on a Landing Page

The Story Behind the Tutorial
=============================

*You have been commissioned with creating a website for the It's a Dog's World magazine, a periodical for dog owners. It's a Dog's World is a magazine focused on content-rich articles, a comprehensive encyclopedia of <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="79690b32-2a5f-490c-9ad3-9bdee7ff5359">dog breeds</span> and useful dog care advice.*

*Your main objective is to create a welcome page that would showcase the magazine's three most important types of content: articles, dog breed information and tips.*

We will do this by means of a Landing Page, making use of its specific blocks, and crafting our own as well.

<span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img src="attachments/32868209/32868208.png" title="It&#39;s a Dog&#39;s World - final result" alt="It&#39;s a Dog&#39;s World - final result" class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="600" /></span>

### Why use a Landing Page?

A Landing Page is particularly fitted to what you need to do in this tutorial. You can build and customize it once, and later the magazine's editor can create and publish <span class="inline-comment-marker" data-ref="836a2b30-3b87-4ec8-a381-29ccddff48e5">new content</span> that will automatically land in the correct place on the front page.

For showcasing articles we will use a Schedule Block, a special Landing Page element that lets you plan the times and order at which content will air.

We will display entries from the Dog Breed encyclopedia using a Content List Block. This block will automatically find all Dog Breed Content items and display their previews in a separate column.

Finally, we will display one random tip of the day using a special, custom block we will build during this tutorial.
