<span id="title-text"> Developer : Get Started with eZ Enterprise </span>
=========================================================================

Created by <span class="author"> Dominika Kurek</span>, last modified on May 09, 2016

If you are looking for even more than eZ Platform can offer you, eZ Enterprise is the thing for you. A commercial offering, it rests atop eZ Platform and taps into all that it offers. With its intuitive in-page editing to landing page management, it delivers fully integrated tools that help you create and manage content on eZ Platform-powered sites and apps.

 

From the developer's point of view, working with eZ Enterprise is not much different than operating on eZ Platform, because the core of the system remains the same.
