<span id="title-text"> Developer : Extending PlatformUI with new navigation </span>
===================================================================================

Introduction
------------

This tutorial aims at providing a step-by-step guide on how to extend the JavaScript application provided by <a href="https://github.com/ezsystems/PlatformUIBundle" class="external-link">the PlatformUI bundle</a>. 

In this tutorial, we will create a new part of the application allowing to browse your content by Content Type instead of using the tree structure. To fully benefit from this document, you need to:

-   be comfortable with eZ Platform's content model (Content, Location, Content Type, etc.)
-   have basic to intermediate level in HTML5/CSS/JavaScript
-   have a basic knowledge of Symfony's concepts (Bundle, Controller and routing)
-   have read the [PlatformUI technical introduction](Extending-eZ-Platform_31429689.html)

This tutorial is divided into 9 steps. The complete code base is available on Github in <a href="https://github.com/ezsystems/ExtendingPlatformUIConferenceBundle" class="external-link">the ExtendingPlatformUIConferenceBundle repository</a> which also provides a tag for each step. The expected end result can be seen in this screencast:
