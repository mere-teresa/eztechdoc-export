**Release FAQ**

*Question*: Prior to the Long Term Support (LTS) release of eZ Platform v1.7.0, I see several different product names. How can I learn more about changes to product naming and features over the years?

*Answer:* eZ Platform and eZ Platform Enterprise Edition are the names of the latest versions. eZ Systems has a rich history of innovation and growth, represented by several iterations over almost two decades. As a result, it may be helpful to read more about that history if you are interested in the versions released prior to eZ Platform and eZ Platform Enterprise Edition version 1.7.0 (LTS) released on December 15, 2016, to help you navigate the product names and features from the past.
