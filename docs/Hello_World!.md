# Hello World!

Now your installation is ready and you're on your way to starting work with eZ Platform.

To access the back office of your installation, append `/ez` to its path: &lt;`your_installation path>/ez`. You will be prompted for the username and password, which by default are:

username: admin
password: publish

 

A clean installation of eZ Platform is empty, so you only get a single page with a rudimentary content model. This is a blank canvas for you to create and customize your own structure.

If you'd like to take a look at an example of using the system to construct a fully functional page, you can also [install eZ Platform with the Demo Bundle](eZ_Platform_Demo).
