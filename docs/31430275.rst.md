**Content items**

A Content item is the basic unit of content that is managed in the
platform.

The substance of a Content item is made up of different Fields and their
values, as defined by the Content Type. These Fields can cover data
ranging from single variables or text lines to media files or passages
of formatted text.

Aside from the Fields, each Content item is also characterized by
general data that controls the Content item’s place in the system.

**Content item general information**

**Content ID** – a unique number by which the Content item is identified
in the system. These numbers are not recycled, so if an item is deleted,
its ID number will not be reused when a new one is created.

**Name** – a user-friendly name for the Content item. The name is
generated automatically based on a pattern specified in the Content Type
definition.

<div
class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note">
<div class="confluence-information-macro-body">
Content item Name is always searchable, even if the Field(s) used to
generate it are not.

</div>
</div>
**Type** – the Content Type on which the Content item is based.

**Owner** – a reference to the user who initially created the Content
item. This reference is set by the system the first time the Content
item is published. The ownership of an item cannot be modified and will
not change even if the owner is removed from the system.

**Creation time** – exact date and time when the Content item was
published for the first time. This is set by the system and cannot be
modified.

**Modification time** – exact date and time when the Content item was
last modified. This is set by the system and cannot be modified
manually, but will change every time the item is published again.

**Status** – the current state of the Content item. It can have three
statuses: 0 – Draft, 1 – Published and 2 – Archived. When an item is
created, its status is set to *draft*. After publishing the status
changes to *published*. When a published Content item is moved to Trash,
this item becomes *archived*. If a published item is removed from the
Trash (or removed without being put in the Trash first), it will be
permanently deleted. 

**Section ID** – the unique number of the Section to which the Content
item belongs. New Content items are placed in the Standard section by
default. This behavior can be changed, but content must always belong to
some Section.

**Versions** – total number of versions of this Content item. A new
version is created every time the Content item is modified and it is
this new version that is edited. The previous / published version along
with earlier versions remain untouched and its status changed to
*Archived*. A Content item always has at least one version.

The Fields that are available in a Content item are defined by the
Content Type to which the Content item belongs.

 

**Content Types**

**Content Type metadata**

Each Content Type is characterized by a set of metadata which define the
general behavior of its instances:

**Name** – a user-friendly name that describes the Content Type. This
name is used in the interface, but not internally by the system. It can
consist of letters, digits, spaces and special characters; the maximum
length is 255 characters. (Mandatory.)

<div
class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note">
<div class="confluence-information-macro-body">
Note that even if your Content Type defines a Field meant to store a
name for the Content item (for example, a title of an article or product
name), this will not be the same as this Name, as this one is a piece of
metadata, not a Field.

</div>
</div>
**Identifier** – an identifier for internal use in configuration files,
templates, PHP code, etc. It must be unique, can only contain lowercase
letters, digits and underscores; the maximum length is 50 characters.
(Mandatory.)

**Description** – a detailed description of the Content Type.
(Optional.)

**Content name pattern** – a pattern for naming a new Content item based
on this Content Type. The pattern usually consists of [Field
identifiers](#Contentitems,ContentTypesandFields-Field_identifier) that
tell the system about which Fields it should use when generating the
name of a Content item. Each Field identifier has to be surrounded with
angle brackets. Text outside the angle brackets will be included
literally. If no pattern is provided, the system will automatically use
the first Field. (Optional.)

**URL alias name pattern** – a pattern which controls how the virtual
URLs of the Locations will be generated when Content items are created
based on this Content Type. Note that only the last part of the virtual
URL is affected. The pattern works in the same way as the Content name
pattern. Text outside the angle brackets will be converted using the
selected method of URL transformation. If no pattern is provided, the
system will automatically use the name of the Content item itself.
(Optional.)

**Container** – a flag which indicates if Content items based on this
Content Type are allowed to have sub-items or not.

<div
class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note">
<div class="confluence-information-macro-body">
This flag was added for convenience and only affects the interface. In
other words, it doesn’t control any actual low-level logic, it simply
controls the way the graphical user interface behaves.

</div>
</div>
**Default field for sorting children** – rule for sorting sub-items. If
the instances of this Content Type can serve as containers, their
children will be sorted according to what is selected here.

**Default sort order** – another rule for sorting sub-items. This
decides the sort order for the criterion chosen above.

**Default content availability** – a flag which indicates if Content
items of this Content Type should be available even without a
corresponding language version. If this flag is not set, a Content item
of this Type will not be available when it does not have a language
version corresponding to the current siteaccess. By setting this flag
you can make instances of this Content Type available regardless of the
language criterion.

Type](attachments/31430275/31431659.png){.confluence-embedded-image

**Field definitions**

Aside from the metadata, a Content Type contains any number of Field
definitions (but has to contain at least one). They determine what
Fields of what Field Types will be included in all Content items created
based on this Content Type.

A Content Type and its Field definitions can be modified after creation,
even if there are already Content items based on it in the system. When
a Content Type is modified, each of its instances will be changed as
well. If a new Field definition is added to a Content Type, this Field
will appear (empty) in every relevant Content item. If a Field
definition is deleted from the Content Type, all the corresponding
Fields will be removed from Content items of this type.

V1.3

You can assign each Field defined in a Content Type to a group by
selecting one of the groups in the Category drop-down. [Available groups
can be configured in the content
repository](Repository_31432023.html#Repository-ContentRepositoryConfiguration).

</div>
</div>
 

 

**Fields**

A Field is the smallest unit of storage in the content model and the
building block that all Content items consist of. Every Field belongs to
a Field Type.

**Field value validation**

The values entered in a field may undergo validation, which means the
system makes sure that they are correct for the chosen Field Type and
can be used without a problem.

Whether validation is performed or not depends on the settings of a
particular Field Type. Validation cannot be turned off for a Field if
its Field Type supports it.

**Field details**

Aside from the Field Type, the Field definition in a Content Type
provides the following information:

**Name** – a user-friendly name that describes the Field. This name is
used in the interface, but not internally by the system. It can consist
of letters, digits, spaces and special characters; the maximum length is
255 characters. If no name is provided, a unique one is automatically
generated.

**Identifier** – an identifier for internal use in configuration files,
templates, PHP code, etc. It can only contain lowercase letters, digits
and underscores; the maximum length is 50 characters. This identifier is
also used in name patterns for the Content Type.

**Description** – a detailed description of the Field.

**Required** – a flag which indicates if the Field must have a value for
the system to accept the Content item. In other words, if a Field is
flagged as Required, a user will not be able to save or publish a
Content item without filling in this Field.

<div
class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note">
<div class="confluence-information-macro-body">
Note that the Required flag is in no way related to Field validation. A
Field’s value is validated whether the Field is set as required or not.

</div>
</div>
[**Searchable**](Search_31429673.html)– a flag which indicates if the
value of the Field will be indexed for searching.

<div
class="confluence-information-macro confluence-information-macro-note">
<div class="confluence-information-macro-body">
The Searchable flag is not available for some Fields, because some Field
Types do not allow searching through their values.

</div>
</div>
**[Translatable](Internationalization_31429671.html)** – a flag which
indicates if the value of the Field can be translated. This is
independent of the Field Type, which means that even Fields of Types
such as “Float” or “Image” can be set as translatable.

 

Depending on the Field Type, there may also be other, specific
information to fill in. For example, the “Country” Field Type allows you
to select the default country, as well as to allow selecting multiple
countries at the same time.
