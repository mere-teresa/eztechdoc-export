# Interfacing with eZ: APIs and GUIs

You can interface with eZ Platform using both APIs and a GUI.

eZ Platform offers two APIs:

-   the [REST API](REST_API_Guide) allows you to interact with an eZ Platform installation using the HTTP protocol, following a REST interaction model,
-   the [Public (PHP) API](Public_API_Guide) exposes a Repository which allows you to create, read, update, manage and delete all objects available in eZ Platform, first and foremost content, but also related objects like sections, locations, content types, content types groups, languages and so on.

 

The graphical interface available through the [backend interface](Extending_eZ_Platform) allows editors and content managers to easily create and manipulate content without developer knowledge. The GUI also covers a number of fundamental administrative operations available in an Admin Panel.

You can find a description and guide for using the GUI for non-developers in a [separate documentation center](https://doc.ez.no/display/USER/Documentation).
