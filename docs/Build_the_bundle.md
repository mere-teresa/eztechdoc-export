# Build the bundle

FieldTypes, like any other eZ Platform extensions, must be provided as Symfony 2 bundles. This chapter covers the creation and organization of this bundle.

First, we explain how to generate the skeleton for a standard Symfony 2 bundle using the console: [Create the bundle](Create_the_bundle). Then, we explain what structure we suggest for storing a Field Type inside a bundle: [Structure the bundle](Structure_the_bundle).
