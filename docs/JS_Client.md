# JS Client

The JavaScript REST API Client is a JavaScript library meant to ease the use of the eZ Platform REST API. For now, it can only be used in a web browser.

See [Using the JavaScript REST API Client](Using_the_JavaScript_REST_API_Client) for a guide on how to use the client, and view the [generated JS API Client reference](http://ezsystems.github.io/javascript-rest-client/).
