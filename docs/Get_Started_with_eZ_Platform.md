#### Transitioning to eZ Platform

If you've worked with **eZ Publish** (our legacy product) in the past, see [Migration from eZ Publish](Migration_from_eZ_Publish), and a [Feature Comparison](https://doc.ez.no/display/MAIN/Transitioning+from+eZ+Publish+to+eZ+Platform+and+eZ+Studio%3A+Feature+Comparison) between eZ Publish (legacy) and eZ Platform (current).

If you've worked with **other CMS's** before, see [Migrating to eZ Platform](../DEVELOPER/Migrating_to_eZ_Platform_-_Follow_the_Ibex!).
